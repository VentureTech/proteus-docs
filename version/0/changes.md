# Version 0 of the Proteus Framework

## Changes in v0.4.5

2014-02-28 Russ Tennant

	[PF #359] Blocking - Detaching CSS from page management doesn't work
	Remove delete-orphan cascade from many-to-many property.
	
	[PF #360] Blocking - Can't log in via token
	Added methods for obtaining a Hostname or Site without
	having the RenderContext initialized. This allows the authentication
	domain to be retrieved before the CMS RenderContext has been
	initialized.

	Moved FilterChainProxy registration.

## Changes in v0.4.4

2014-02-27  Russ Tennant 

        Create ProteusShell so we can bootstrap the shell ourselves.
        Initially, this just changes how the application context is created.
        It now reads the system property spring.config to obtain spring
        @Configurations due to the bean ordering/overriding issue with the
        shell bootstrap class.

        [PF #349] Page Editor / Error trying to edit a box to override contents
        The SQL generated by the HQL query in CmsBackendDAO.hasContentForBox
        is invalid in the new version of hibernate. Rewrote the HQL in order
        to get hibernate to generate valid SQL.

        [PF #230] Update to support null password.

        [PF #230] Add CliCommand annotation as an entry point.

        [PF #230] Workaround for IndexOutOfBoundsException.

        [PF #230] Process for adding users to a fresh Proteus db snapshot
        Add data conversion for renaming default admin group and role.

        [PF #230] Process for adding users to a fresh Proteus db snapshot
        Created command to add users to the backend.

        [PF #350] Remove spacer from actions div.


## Changes in v0.4.3

2014-02-25  Russ Tennant 

        [PF #343] Add StaticKeyDataConfig command to Proteus Shell

        StaticKeyDataConfig: 
         Add missing properties to copy constructor. Add scanPackage mutators.

        [PF #327] Error on attempt to reset password
        Added a data conversion to add an email template for the
        backend reset password component.

2014-02-24  Russ Tennant 

        [PF #173] CommunicationConfig - not sure if in good package
        Moved cache configs to net.proteusframework.$module.config package.

        [PF #330] Changing revision limit caused files to be lost
        Add back check for same stream storage when processing files. Appears to have been accidentally removed when the email notifications were removed.

        [PF #314] Incorrect usage of window.setTimeout  method

        [PF #299] RadioButtonComponent has seemingly incorrect id attribute
        When converting some code to use dashes into underscores for consistency,
        the radio button ID was missed in one place causing a mismatch between
        the label.for and the input.id.

        [PF #331 #240] Template Management / CSS bug when editing name
        Invalidate parent in setVisible, setEnabled, and setEditable.

        [PF #326] Styles in menu component are missing
        miwt_highlight class was missing some replacements with miwt-tree class.

        [PF #318] Page Management / Live Preview Button Opens In Window
        When rendering an external action link, do not include the submit
        feature. The submit feature causes JavaScript code to handle opening
        a new window and we do not want to do that in this case.

        [PF #199] SAF - add the ability to pick files independently

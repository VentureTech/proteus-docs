title: Java Development
---

# Overview
This unit introduces advanced Java features and idioms, Linux basics, and some good software engineering practices.  Use the given references, plus any others you find, to learn about the topics mentioned here.  *Explore the first part of each section fully (up to “Other References”), and peruse the Other References sections as needed.*  There is *much* information available about Java and software engineering; focus especially (but not only) on the information you need to complete the exercises at the end.

# Environment
While you could theoretically develop Java applications on any platform, you will find it helpful to use the same environment as other VentureTech engineers.

We run Linux as a virtual *guest* operating system within another *host* OS, usually Windows.  We use [VMWare] (http://www.vmware.com/) to do this.  Nearly all of your development will be done in the guest Linux OS. 

Set up your virtual development environment using one of our images and instructions.
Once you have opened the image, you may want to do the Unix Primer below, then come back and finish setting up the virtual development environment.
[Virtual Development Machine Setup] (https://docs.google.com/a/vipasolutions.com/document/d/1-Wvp1A9p3qeetbEblxh0DOWgvzkyQ7qLfwhFu25s3Yo/edit?usp=sharing)

Follow this primer and do the tasks in it to learn the basics of working in Linux.
[Unix Primer] (http://cs.iupui.edu/~droberts/n311/resources/unixprimer.htm)
(Note: Linux is Unix-like enough that most Unix information will apply.)

You may use any IDE, but other engineers at VentureTech currently use IntelliJ IDEA, so that will probably be the best option.

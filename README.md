Content in the gh-pages branch is public through GitHub Pages.
 * The master branch is empty and should be ignored
 * The gh-pages branch contains source (e.g. DocBook XML) in the "_docbook" directories (where the underscore causes GitHub Pages / Jekyll to ignore them), plus published documents, e.g. HTML
